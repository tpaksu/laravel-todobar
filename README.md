# Laravel TodoBar

TodoBar creates an overlay right sidebar to ease your Laravel projects task management.

- It stores the tasks in a JSON file which is located in `/resources/todobar` folder, which is shared among your code in your repository, so you can get the tasks on every platform that you are developing your project.

- It supports multiple groups, which you can use to track different aspects of your project in a single file, and you can easily switch between groups with a single dropdown.

- It uses Bootstrap components as the frontend library, and for the "Edit Task" modal.

## Installation
You can install the package via composer with:

```
composer require tpaksu/laravel-todobar --dev
```

The sidebar will be enabled by default, but you can disable it by adding

    TODOBAR_ENABLED=false

to your environment variables and run `php artisan config:cache` to update the configuration cache.


## Package Contents

This package publishes the views used in the package and a configuration file which consists of three settings:

- **enabled**: Enables the sidebar by setting the environment variable (`TODOBAR_ENABLED`) in your `.env` file, or by changing the default value when the environment value is missing.

- **start_visible**: Defines the visibility on page load, if you set it to true, the sidebar will be shown on page load.

- **overlay**: Defines if the sidebar will cover some part of the web page (overlay), or shrink the page and display the whole page besides itself.

The views used and published by this package:

    + resources/views/vendor/tpaksu/todobar
    +-- partials
    |   +-- form.blade.php
    |   |-- handle.blade.php
    |   |-- projects.blade.php
    |   +-- tasks blade.php
    +-- todobar.blade.php

## Extending

The package contains a `Storage` folder which contains an interface `DataStorageInterface` defining the data storage provider repository, and an example `JSONStorage` class which handles the data persisting in JSON file. If you want to use something different than a JSON file to store your tasks, you can create a class implementing `DataStorageInterface` and make the package use that instead by injecting your class instead `JSONStorage` in `TodoBarServiceProvider.php` file:

```php
    $this->app->singleton(DataStorageInterface::class, function () {
        // replace this line with your class
        return new JSONStorage("items.json");
    });
```
